
What is a Algorithm? 

> An algorithm is a finite set of unambiguous instructions for solving a problem.

>> An algorithm is correct if on all legitimate inputs, it outputs the right answer in a finite amount of time

> Can be expressed as
>>pseudocode
>>flow charts
>>text in a natural language (e.g. English)
>>computer code

Algorithm Design

> The theoretical  study of how to solve  computational problems
>>sorting a list of numbers
>>   finding a shortest route on a map
>> scheduling when to work on homework
>> answering web search queries
>> and so on...

The Importance of Algorithms

> Their impact is broad and far-reaching.
>> Internet. Web search, packet routing, ...
>> Computers. Circuit layout, file system, compilers, ...
>> Computer graphics. Movies, virtual reality, ...
>> Security. Cell phones, e-commerce, ...
>> Multimedia. MP3, JPG, DivX, HDTV, ...
>> Social networks.  Recommendations, news feeds, ads, ...
