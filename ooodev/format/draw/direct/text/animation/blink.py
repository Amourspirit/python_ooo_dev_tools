        Constructor.

        Args:
            start_inside: bool, optional): Start inside.
                If this value is ``True``, the text is visible at the start of the animation.
            visible_on_exit (bool, optional): Visible on exit.
                If this value is ``True``, the text is visible at the end of the animation.
            increment (float, UnitT, optional): Increment value.
                A positive float represents MM units, a negative value represents pixels,
                or a ``UnitT`` instance can be passed in.
            delay (int, optional): Delay in milliseconds.
                This is the delay in thousandths of a second (milliseconds) between each of the animation steps.
                A value of 0 means automatic delay.

        Returns:
            None:
