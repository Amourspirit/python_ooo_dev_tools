        Listener has the chance to break that by throwing a CloseVetoException.
        This exception must be passed to the original caller of ``XCloseable.close()`` without any interaction.

        The parameter ``gets_ownership`` regulate who has to try to close the listened object again,
        if this listener disagree with the request by throwing the exception.
        If it's set to ``False`` the original caller of ``XCloseable.close()`` will be the owner in every case.
        It's not allowed to call ``close()`` from this listener then.
        If it's set to ``True`` this listener will be the new owner if he throw the exception, otherwise not!
        If his still running processes will be finished he must call ``close()`` on listened object again then.

        If this listener doesn't disagree with th close request it depends from his internal implementation if he deregister itself at the listened object.
        But normally this must be done in ``XCloseListener.notifyClosing()``.

        Note:
            This implementation raises a ``queryClosing`` event in the event system.
