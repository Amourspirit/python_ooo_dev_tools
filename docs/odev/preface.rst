Star Basic is the native language of Star Office which has been incorporated by Open Office and Libre Office. This means that all other supported languages must negotiate a basic bridge.

This `comment <https://stackoverflow.com/a/64517979/>`_ from Dan Dascalescu offers a challenge to the community:

    after 20 years of software development, the LibreOffice API is the crappiest one I've had the "pleasure" of working with.
    The documentation is `horrible <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/servicecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1util_1_1SearchDescriptor.html>`_
    ,spread all over the place, `littered with Uyghur <https://bug-attachments.documentfoundation.org/attachment.cgi?id=166685>`_
    , or `completely missing <https://ask.libreoffice.org/en/question/98257/javascript-macro-reference>`_.
    The LibreOffice macro IDE is also extremely unhelpful.

|app_name_bold| (|app_name_short|) offers a python framework for the community to take another step to change this.
The starting point is `Java LibreOffice Programming <https://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/jlop/>`_ which we thank
Andrew Davison for kindly making available provided his work is acknowledged.

Changes required are reformatting for this media since the scripts have missed a lot of detail including code,
generalising the content so it is more widely applicable to supported languages and complementing Python examples with examples of other language.
Please contribute where you can.
