Chapter 10. The Linguistics API

.. topic:: Overview

    Linguistic Tools; Using the Spell Checker; Using the Thesaurus; Grammar Checking; Guessing the Language used in a String; Spell Checking and Grammar Checking a Document

The linguistics API has four main components:

1. spell checker
2. hyphenator
3. thesaurus
4. grammar checker (which Office calls a proof reader).

We'll look at how to program using the spell checker, thesaurus, and two grammar checkers, but skip the hyphenator which is easier to use interactively through Office's GUI.

However, if you have an urge to hyphenate, then ``LingusticExamples.java`` in the Developer's Guide examples contains some code;
it can be downloaded from https://api.libreoffice.org/examples/DevelopersGuide/OfficeDev/Linguistic/LinguisticExamples.java.
