    Calling Calc Functions from Code; Pivot Tables; Goal Seek; Linear and Nonlinear Solving (using ``SCO``, ``DEPS``)

    Examples: |fun_ex|_, |pivot_ex|_, |goal_ex|_, |solve_ex|_, and |nl_solve_ex|_.

This chapter looks at how to utilize Calc's spreadsheet functions directly from Python, and
then examines four of Calc's data analysis features: pivot tables, goal seeking, and linear and nonlinear solving.
There are two nonlinear examples, one using the ``SCO`` solver, the using employing ``DEPS``.

27.1 Calling Calc Functions from Code
=====================================

Calc comes with an extensive set of functions, which are described in Appendix B of the Calc User Guide, available from `<https://libreoffice.org/get-help/documentation>`__.
The information is also online at `<https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Functions_by_Category>`__, organized into eleven categories:

1. | Database: for extracting information from Calc tables, where the data is organized into rows.
   | The "Database" name is a little misleading, but the documentation makes the point that
   | Calc database functions have nothing to do with Base databases. Chapter 13 of the
   | Calc User Guide ("Calc as a Simple Database") explains the distinction in detail.
2. Date and Time; :abbreviation:`i.e.` see the ``EASTERSUNDAY`` function below
3. Financial: for business calculations;
4. Information: many of these return boolean information about cells, such as whether a cell contains text or a formula;
5. Logical: functions for boolean logic;
6. Mathematical: trigonometric, hyperbolic, logarithmic, and summation functions; e.g. see ROUND, SIN, and RADIANS below;
7. Array: many of these operations treat cell ranges like 2D arrays; :abbreviation:`i.e.` see TRANSPOSE below;
8. Statistical: for statistical and probability calculations; :abbreviation:`i.e.`, see AVERAGE and SLOPE below;
9. Spreadsheet: for finding values in tables, cell ranges, and cells;
10. Text: string manipulation functions;
11. | Add-ins: a catch-all category that includes a lot of functions â€“ extra data and time operations, conversion functions between number bases, more statistics, and complex numbers.
    | See IMSUM and ROMAN below for examples.
    | The "Add-ins" documentation starts at |calc_add_in|_, and continues in
    | `Add-in Functions, List of Analysis Functions Part One <https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/scalc/01/04060115.html>`__ and
    | `Add-in Functions, List of Analysis Functions Part Two <https://help.libreoffice.org/latest/en-US/text/scalc/01/04060116.html>`__.

A different organization for the functions documentation is used at the OpenOffice site (`Calc Functions listed by category <https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Calc:_Functions_listed_by_category>`__),
and is probably easy to use when browsing/searching for a suitable function.

If you know the name of the function, then a reasonably effective way of finding its documentation is to search for ``libreoffice calc function`` + the function name.

The standard way of using these functions is, of course, inside cell formulae.
But it's also possible to call them from code via the XFunctionAccess_ interface.
XFunctionAccess_ only contains a single function, ``callFunction()``, but it can be a bit hard to use due to data typing issues.

:py:meth:`.Calc.call_fun` creates an XFunctionAccess_ instance, and executes ``callFunction()``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class
        @staticmethod
        def call_fun(func_name: str, *args: any) -> object:
            args_len = len(args)
            if args_len == 0:
                arg = ()
            else:
                arg = args
            try:
                fa = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
                    XFunctionAccess, "com.sun.star.sheet.FunctionAccess", raise_err=True
                )
                return fa.callFunction(func_name.upper(), arg)
            except Exception as e:
                Lo.print(f"Could not invoke function '{func_name.upper()}'")
                Lo.print(f"    {e}")
            return None

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

:py:meth:`.Calc.call_fun` is passed the Calc function name and and optionally an sequence of arguments.
The function's result is returned as an Object instance.

Several examples of how to use :py:meth:`.Calc.call_fun` can be found in the |fun_ex|_ example:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        def main(self) -> None:
            with Lo.Loader(Lo.ConnectPipe()) as loader:
                doc = Calc.create_doc(loader)
                sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc, index=0)
                # round
                print("ROUND result for 1.999 is: ", end="")
                print(Calc.call_fun("ROUND", 1.999))
                # more explained below.

                Lo.close(closeable=doc, deliver_ownership=False)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The printed result is:

::

    ROUND result for 1.999 is: 2.0

Function calls can be nested, as in:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
        :emphasize-lines: 3

        # in calc_functions.py
        print("SIN result for 30 degrees is:", end="")
        print(f'{Calc.call_fun("SIN", Calc.call_fun("RADIANS", 30)):.3f}')

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The call to ``RADIANS`` converts ``30`` degrees to radians.
The returned Object is accepted by the ``SIN`` function as input.
The output is: ``SIN`` result for ``30`` degrees is: ``0.500`` Many functions require more than one argument.

For instance:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        avg = float(Calc.call_fun("AVERAGE", 1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
        print(f"Average of the numbers is: {avg:.1f}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

This reports the average to be ``3.0``.

When the Calc function documentation talks about an "array" or "matrix" argument, then the data needs to be packaged as a 2D sequence such as list or tuple.
However for methods that were tested that required a matrix is showed that a list or tuple was not accepted.
What does work however, is writing the 2D data into a sheet and reading it back as XCellRange_ values.

For example, the ``SLOPE`` function takes two arrays of x and y coordinates as input, and calculates the slope of the line through them.
So first the 2D array is written to the sheet using :py:meth:`.Calc.set_array`.
Next the value are read from the sheet as XCellRange_ values into ``xrng`` and ``yrng``.
Now ``xrng`` and ``yrng`` can be passed to ``SLOPE``.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        # the slope function only seems to work if passed XCellRange
        arr = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [3.0, 6.0, 9.0]]
        Calc.set_array(values=arr, sheet=sheet, name="A1")
        Lo.delay(500)
        xrng = Calc.get_cell_range(sheet=sheet, range_name="A1:C1")
        yrng = Calc.get_cell_range(sheet=sheet, range_name="A2:C2")
        slope = float(Calc.call_fun("SLOPE", yrng, xrng))
        print(f"SLOPE of the line: {slope}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The slope result is ``3.0``, as expected.


The functions in the "Array" category almost all use 2D arrays as arguments. For example, the ``TRANSPOSE`` function is called like so:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        arr = [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]
        Calc.set_array(values=arr, sheet=sheet, name="A1")
        Lo.delay(500)
        rng = Calc.get_cell_range(sheet=sheet, range_name="A1:C3")
        trans_mat = Calc.call_fun("TRANSPOSE", rng)
        # add a little extra formatting
        fl = FormatterTable(format=(".1f", ">5"))
        Calc.print_array(trans_mat, fl)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None


The input array is in row-order, so the ``arr`` created above has two rows and three columns.
Extra formatting is use by passing :py:meth:`.Calc.print_array` a :ref:`formatters_formatter_table` instance.
The printed transpose is:

::

    Row x Column size: 3 x 3
      1.0  4.0
      2.0  5.0
      3.0  6.0

Note that the result of this call to :py:meth:`.Calc.call_fun` is a 2D tuple.

There are several functions for manipulating imaginary numbers, which must be written in the form of strings.
For example, ``IMSUM`` sums a series of complex numbers like so:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        # sum two imaginary numbers: "13+4j" + "5+3j" returns 18+7j.
        sum = Calc.call_fun("IMSUM", "13+4j", "5+3j")
        print(f"13+4j + 5+3j: {sum}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The summed complex number is returned as the string ``"18+7j"``. This means that the :py:meth:`.Calc.call_fun` result is cast to String in this case.

.. _ch27_func_help:

Functions Help
--------------

If you can't access the Calc documentation on functions, then :py:class:`calc.Calc` contains two help functions: :py:meth:`.Calc.get_function_names` and :py:meth:`.Calc.print_function_info`.
The former prints a very long array of function names:

.. cssclass:: rst-collapse

    .. collapse:: List of 508 Functions

If you know a function name, then :py:meth:`.Calc.print_function_info` will print details about it.

For instance, information about the ``ROMAN`` function is obtained like so:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        Calc.print_function_info("ROMAN")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The output is:

::

    Properties for "ROMAN"":
      Id: 383
      Category: 10
      Name: ROMAN
      Description: Converts a number to a Roman numeral.
      Arguments: [Number, Mode (optional)]

    No. of arguments: 2
    1. Argument name: Number
      Description: 'The number to be converted to a Roman numeral must be in the 0 - 3999 range.'
      Is optional?: False

    2. Argument name: Mode
      Description: 'The more this value increases, the more the Roman numeral is simplified. The value must be in the 0 - 4 range.'
      Is optional?: True

This output states that ``ROMAN`` can be called with one or two arguments, the first being a decimal,
and the second an optional argument for the amount of 'simplification' carried out on the Roman numeral.
For example, here are two ways to convert ``999`` into Roman form:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in calc_functions.py
        # Roman numbers
        roman = Calc.call_fun("ROMAN", 999)
        # use max simplification
        roman4 = Calc.call_fun("ROMAN", 999, 4)
        print(f"999 in Roman numerals: {roman} or {roman4}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The output is:

:: 

    999 in Roman numerals: CMXCIX or IM

:py:meth:`.Calc.get_function_names` and :py:meth:`.Calc.print_function_info` utilize the XFunctionDescriptions_ interface for retrieving an indexed container of function descriptions.
Each function description is an array of PropertyValue_ objects, which contain a ``Name`` property.
:py:meth:`.Calc.find_function` uses this organization to return a tuple of PropertyValue_ for a given function name:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class (simplified, overlaods)
        @staticmethod
        def find_function(func_nm: str) -> Tuple[PropertyValue] | None:
            if not func_nm:
                raise ValueError("Invalid arg, please supply a function name to find.")
            try:
                func_desc = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
                    XFunctionDescriptions, "com.sun.star.sheet.FunctionDescriptions", raise_err=True
                )
            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception("No function descriptions were found") from e

            for i in range(func_desc.getCount()):
                try:
                    props = cast(Sequence[PropertyValue], func_desc.getByIndex(i))
                    for p in props:
                        if p.Name == "Name" and str(p.Value) == func_nm:
                            return tuple(props)
                except Exception:
                    continue
            Lo.print(f"Function '{func_nm}' not found")
            return None

The tuple of PropertyValue_ contains five properties: ``Name``, ``Description``, ``Id``, ``Category``, and ``Arguments``.
The ``Arguments`` property stores an array of FunctionArgument_ objects which contain information about each argument's name, description, and whether it is optional.
This information is printed by :py:meth:`.Calc.print_fun_arguments`:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class
        @classmethod
        def print_fun_arguments(cls, prop_vals: Sequence[PropertyValue]) -> None:
            fargs = cast(
                "Sequence[FunctionArgument]", mProps.Props.get_value(name="Arguments", props=prop_vals)
            )
            if fargs is None:
                print("No arguments found")
                return

            print(f"No. of arguments: {len(fargs)}")
            for i, fa in enumerate(fargs):
                print(f"{i+1}. Argument name: {fa.Name}")
                print(f"  Description: '{fa.Description}'")
                print(f"  Is optional?: {fa.IsOptional}")

:py:meth:`.Calc.print_function_info` calls :py:meth:`.Calc.find_function` to report on a complete function:

        @classmethod
        def print_function_info(cls, func_name: str) -> None:

            if prop_vals is None:
                return
            Props.show_props(func_name, prop_vals)

27.2 Pivot Tables
=================

Pivot tables are explained in detail in chapter 8 of the Calc User's Guide.
They allow a user to view a spreadsheet consisting of columns of data in a variety of table formats, thereby highlighting the relationships between the columns.
For example, :numref:`ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet` shows the small spreadsheet in ``pivottable1.ods`` of the |pivot_ex|_ example.

..
    figure 1

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/205520246-082f61cc-7f6a-46f2-88c6-1eed254735f7.png
        :alt: The pivottable1 Spreadsheet
        :figclass: align-center

        :The ``pivottable1.ods`` Spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet uses a database-like organization, with each row acting as a record, and each column is a different type/kind of information.
This formatting style is described in chapter 13 "Calc as a Simple Database" in the User Guide.

The drawback of this kind of data structuring is that it can be difficult to see the underlying relationships between the columns;
this is where pivot tables can help.

For example, a pivot table can be generated showing how the ``Category`` column affects ``Revenue`` (see :numref:`ch27fig_cat_aff_rev`).

        :figclass: align-center

        :``Category`` Affecting ``Revenue``


Note that the pivot table shows the ``revenue`` sum in column ``B``, since several revenue entries in the original sheet are covered by each category.

Alternatively, it's possible to see how ``Period`` and ``Category`` interact to affect the ``revenue``, as in :numref:`ch27fig_period_cat_aff_rev`.

        :alt: Period and Category Affect on "Revenue"
        :figclass: align-center

        :``Period`` and ``Category`` Affect on ``Revenue``

The ordering of the ``Period`` values can be changed by clicking on the arrow next to the ``Period`` text in cell ``A2``, then selecting a custom sort (:abbreviation:`i.e.` ``Jan``, ``Feb``, ``Mar``, :abbreviation:`etc.`).

The ``Total Result`` row and column are added automatically, and can be changed easily.
It's also possible to change the way that the revenue data is grouped (:abbreviation:`i.e.` it can be averaged instead of being summed).

Pivot tables are straightforward to create and modify via Calc's GUI, starting from the Data, Pivot Table, Create menu item.
Calc automatically selects all the cells used in the database-like table like the one in :numref:`ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet`, and displays the layout dialog shown in :numref:`ch27fig_pivot_layout_gui`.

        :The Pivot Table Layout GUI.

The right-most "Available Fields" list contains the names of the columns in the sheet, while the other four fields (Filters, Column, Row, and Data) are empty.
:numref:`ch27fig_pivot_layout_gui` shows a bug in the current version of the Pivot Table GUI â€“ the addition of a "Data" name in the "Column" fields list.
This name can be ignored since it doesn't appear in the rendered pivot table.

The pivot table layout in :numref:`ch27fig_layout_for_fig3` is easily created by dragging the ``Period`` name to the Row fields list,
``Category`` to the Column fields list, and ``Revenue`` to the Data fields list, where it's converted into ``Sum - Revenue``.

Pivot Tables in the API
-----------------------

The Calc API refers to pivot tables by their old Office name, DataPilot tables. The relationships between the DataPilotservices and interfaces are shown in :numref:`ch27fig_data_pilot_srv_interfaces`.

..

        :alt: The DataPilot Services and Interfaces
        :figclass: align-center

        :The DataPilot Services and Interfaces.

:numref:`ch27fig_data_pilot_srv_interfaces` is best understood by reading downwards: a DataPilotTables_ service (note the ``s``) is a sequence of DataPilotTable_ services.
Each table contains a DataPilotFields_ service (note the ``s``) which manages a sequence of DataPilotField_ objects.

Each DataPilotField_ is a named property set, representing a column in the source sheet.
For example, in the following code, four pilot fields will be created for the ``pivottable1.ods`` sheet shown in :numref:`ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet`,
one each for the columns named ``Year``, ``Period``, ``Category``, and ``Revenue``.

:numref:`ch27fig_data_pilot_srv_interfaces` mentions one of the more important services DataPilotDescriptor_, which does the hard work of converting sheet columns into pilot fields.
DataPilotDescriptor_ is also responsible for assigning each pilot field to one of the Filters, Column, Row, or Data field lists.

The |pivot_ex1_py|_ example illustrates how to create the pivot table shown in :numref:`ch27fig_period_cat_aff_rev`.
The program begins by opening the ``pivottable1.ods`` file (:numref:`ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet`):

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in pivot_table1.py
        def main(self) -> None:
            loader = Lo.load_office(Lo.ConnectSocket())

            try:
                doc = Calc.open_doc(fnm=self._fnm, loader=loader)

                GUI.set_visible(is_visible=True, odoc=doc)

                sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc)
                dp_sheet = Calc.insert_sheet(doc=doc, name="Pivot Table", idx=1)

                self._create_pivot_table(sheet=sheet, dp_sheet=dp_sheet)

                if self._out_fnm:
                    Lo.save_doc(doc=doc, fnm=self._out_fnm)

                    Lo.close_office()
                else:
                    print("Keeping document open")

                raise

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

A second sheet (called ``dp_sheet``) is created to hold the generated pivot table, and ``_create_pivot_table()`` is called:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in pivot_table1.py
        def _create_pivot_table(self, sheet: XSpreadsheet, dp_sheet: XSpreadsheet) -> XDataPilotTable | None:
            cell_range = Calc.find_used_range(sheet)
            print(f"The used area is: { Calc.get_range_str(cell_range)}")
            print()

            dp_tables = Calc.get_pilot_tables(sheet)
            dp_desc = dp_tables.createDataPilotDescriptor()
            dp_desc.setSourceRange(Calc.get_address(cell_range))

            # XIndexAccess fields = dpDesc.getDataPilotFields();
            fields = dp_desc.getHiddenFields()
            field_names = Lo.get_container_names(con=fields)
            print(f"Field Names ({len(field_names)}):")
            for name in field_names:
                print(f"  {name}")

            # properties defined in DataPilotField

            # set column field
            props = Lo.find_container_props(con=fields, nm="Category")
            Props.set(props, Orientation=DataPilotFieldOrientation.COLUMN)

            # set row field
            props = Lo.find_container_props(con=fields, nm="Period")
            Props.set(props, Orientation=DataPilotFieldOrientation.ROW)

            # set data field, calculating the sum
            props = Lo.find_container_props(con=fields, nm="Revenue")
            Props.set(props, Orientation=DataPilotFieldOrientation.DATA)
            Props.set(props, Function=GeneralFunction.SUM)

            # place onto sheet
            dest_addr = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=dp_sheet, cell_name="A1")
            dp_tables.insertNewByName("PivotTableExample", dest_addr, dp_desc)
            Calc.set_col_width(sheet=dp_sheet, width=60, idx=0)
            # A column; in mm

            # Usually the table is not fully updated. The cells are often
            # drawn with #VALUE! contents (?).

            # This can be fixed by explicitly refreshing the table, but it has to
            # be accessed via the sheet or the tables container is considered
            # empty, and the table is not found.

            dp_tables2 = Calc.get_pilot_tables(sheet=dp_sheet)
            # return self._refresh_table(dp_tables=dp_tables2, table_name="PivotTableExample")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

All the sheet's data is selected by calling :py:meth:`.Calc.find_used_range`.
Then :py:meth:`.Calc.get_pilot_tables` obtains the DataPilotTables_ service:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class
        @staticmethod
        def get_pilot_table(dp_tables: XDataPilotTables, name: str) -> XDataPilotTable:
            try:
                otable = dp_tables.getByName(name)
                if otable is None:
                    raise Exception(f"Did not find data pilot table '{name}'")
                result = Lo.qi(XDataPilotTable, otable, raise_err=True)
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception(f"Pilot table lookup failed for '{name}'") from e

        get_pivot_table = get_pilot_table

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

:py:meth:`.Calc.get_pilot_tables` utilizes the XDataPilotTablesSupplier_ interface of the Spreadsheet_ service to obtain the DataPilotTables_ service.

|pivot_ex1_py|_'s task is to create a new pilot table, which it does indirectly by creating a new pilot description.
After this pilot description has been initialized, it will be added to the DataPilotTables_ service as a new pilot table.

An empty pilot description is created by calling ``XDataPilotTables.createDataPilotDescriptor()``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in pivot_table1.py
        dp_tables = Calc.get_pilot_tables(sheet)
        dp_desc = dp_tables.createDataPilotDescriptor()

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The new XDataPilotDescriptor reference (``dp_desc``) creates a pilot table by carrying out two tasks- loading the sheet data into the pilot table,
and assigning the resulting pilot fields to the Filters, Column, Row, and Data fields in the descriptor.
This latter task is similar to what the Calc user does in the GUI's layout window in :numref:`ch27fig_layout_for_fig3`.

The descriptor is assigned a source range that spans all the data:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        dp_desc.setSourceRange(Calc.get_address(cell_range))

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

It converts each detected column into a DataPilotField_ service, which is a named property set; the name is the column heading.

These pilot fields are conceptually stored in the "Available Fields" list shown in the layout window in :numref:`ch27fig_layout_for_fig3`,
and are retrieved by calling ``XDataPilotDescriptor.getHiddenFields()``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in pivot_table1.py
        fields = dp_desc.getHiddenFields()

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

It's useful to list the names of these pilot fields:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in pivot_table1.py
        field_names = Lo.get_container_names(con=fields)
        print(f"Field Names ({len(field_names)}):")
        for name in field_names:
            print(f"  {name}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The output for the spreadsheet in :numref:`ch27fig_pivottable1_sheet` is:

::

    Field Names (5):
      Year
      Period
      Category
      Revenue
      Data

This list includes the strange "Data" pilot field which you may remember also cropped up in the layout window in :numref:`ch27fig_pivot_layout_gui`.

The second task is to assign selected pilot fields to the Filters, Column, Row, and Data field lists.
The standard way of doing this is illustrated below for the case of assigning the ``Category`` pilot field to the Column field list:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in PivotTable1._create_pivot_table()
        props = Lo.find_container_props(con=fields, nm="Category")
        Props.set(props, Orientation=DataPilotFieldOrientation.COLUMN)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The fields variable refers to all the pilot fields as an indexed container.

:py:meth:`.Lo.find_container_props` searches through that container looking for the specified field name.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Lo class
        @classmethod
        def find_container_props(cls, con: XIndexAccess, nm: str) -> XPropertySet | None:
            if con is None:
                raise TypeError("Container is null")
            for i in range(con.getCount()):
                try:
                    el = con.getByIndex(i)
                    named = cls.qi(XNamed, el)
                    if named and named.getName() == nm:
                        return cls.qi(XPropertySet, el)
                except Exception:
                    cls.print(f"Could not access element {i}")
            cls.print(f"Could not find a '{nm}' property set in the container")
            return None

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The returned property set is an instance of the DataPilotField_ service, so a complete list of all the properties can be found in its documentation.

The important property for our needs is ``Orientation`` which can be assigned a DataPilotFieldOrientation_ constant, whose values are ``HIDDEN``, ``COLUMN``, ``ROW``, ``PAGE``, and ``DATA``,
representing the field lists in the layout window.

Once the required pilot fields have been assigned to field lists, the new pivot table is added to the other tables and to the sheet by calling ``XDataPilotTables.insertNewByName()``.
It takes three arguments: a unique name for the table, the cell address where the table will be drawn, and the completed pilot descriptor:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in PivotTable1._create_pivot_table()
        dest_addr = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=dp_sheet, cell_name="A1")
        dp_tables.insertNewByName("PivotTableExample", dest_addr, dp_desc)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

This code should mark the end of the ``_create_pivot_table()`` method, but it was found that more complex pivot tables would often not be correctly drawn.
The cells in the Data field would be left containing the word ``#VALUE!``.
This problem can be fixed by explicitly requesting a refresh of the pivot table, using:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in PivotTable1._create_pivot_table()
        def _create_pivot_table(self, sheet: XSpreadsheet, dp_sheet: XSpreadsheet) -> XDataPilotTable | None:
            # ...
            dp_tables2 = Calc.get_pilot_tables(sheet=dp_sheet)
            return self._refresh_table(dp_tables=dp_tables2, table_name="PivotTableExample")

        def _refresh_table(self, dp_tables: XDataPilotTables, table_name: str) -> XDataPilotTable | None:
            nms = dp_tables.getElementNames()
            print(f"No. of DP tables: {len(nms)}")
            for nm in nms:
                print(f"  {nm}")

            dp_table = Calc.get_pilot_table(dp_tables=dp_tables, name=table_name)
            if dp_table is not None:
                dp_table.refresh()
            return dp_table
    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

:py:meth:`.Calc.get_pilot_table` searches XDataPilotTables_, which is a named container of XDataPilotTable_ objects.

Oddly enough, it's not enough to call :py:meth:`.Calc.get_pilot_table` on the current XDataPilotTables_ reference (called ``dp_tables`` in ``_create_pivot_table()``), since the new pivot table isn't found.

.. _ch27_goal_seek:

27.3 Seeking a Goal
===================

The Tools, Goal Seek menu item in Calc allows a formula to be executed 'backwards'.
Instead of supplying the input to a formula, and obtaining the formula's result,
the result is given and "goal seek" works backwards through the formula to calculate the value that produces the result.

The |goal_ex|_ example contains several uses of "goal seeking". It begins like so:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in goal_seek.py
        def main(self) -> None:
            with Lo.Loader(connector=Lo.ConnectPipe()) as loader:
                doc = Calc.create_doc(loader)
                sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc)
                gs = Lo.qi(XGoalSeek, doc)

                # -------------------------------------------------
                # x-variable and starting value
                Calc.set_val(value=9, sheet=sheet, cell_name="C1")
                # formula
                Calc.set_val(value="=SQRT(C1)", sheet=sheet, cell_name="C2")
                x = Calc.goal_seek(gs=gs, sheet=sheet, cell_name="C1", formula_cell_name="C2", result=4.0)
                print(f"x == {x}\n")  # 16.0

                # more goal seek examples ...

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Goal seek functionality is accessed via the XGoalSeek_ interface of the document.
Also, a spreadsheet is needed to hold an initial guess for the input value being calculated (which I'll call the ``x-variable``), and for the formula.
In the example above, the ``x-variable`` is stored in cell ``C1`` with an initial value of ``9``, and its formula (``sqrt(x)``) in cell ``C2``.

:py:meth:`.Calc.goal_seek` is passed the cell names of the ``x-variable`` and formula, and the formula's result, and returns the ``x-value`` that produces that result.
In the example above, :py:meth:`.Calc.goal_seek` returns ``16.0``, because that's the input to ``sqrt()`` that results in ``4``.

:py:meth:`.Calc.goal_seek` is defined as:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class
        @classmethod
        def goal_seek(
            cls, gs: XGoalSeek, sheet: XSpreadsheet, cell_name: str,
            formula_cell_name: str, result: numbers.Number
        ) -> float:
            xpos = cls._get_cell_address_sheet(sheet=sheet, cell_name=cell_name)
            formula_pos = cls._get_cell_address_sheet(sheet=sheet, cell_name=formula_cell_name)

            goal_result = gs.seekGoal(formula_pos, xpos, f"{float(result)}")
            if goal_result.Divergence >= 0.1:
                Lo.print(f"NO result; divergence: {goal_result.Divergence}")
                raise GoalDivergenceError(goal_result.Divergence)
            return goal_result.Result

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The heart of :py:meth:`.Calc.goal_seek` is a call to ``XGoalSeek.seekGoal()`` which requires three arguments:
the address of the ``x-variable`` cell, the address of the formula cell, and a string representing the formula's result.
The call returns a GoalResult_ object that contains two fields:
Result holds the calculated ``x-value``, and Divergence measures the accuracy of the ``x-value``.
If the goal seek has succeeded, then the Divergence value should be very close to ``0``; if it failed to find an ``x-value`` then Divergence may be very large since it measures the amount the ``x-value``
changed in the last iteration of the "goal seek" algorithm.

Not sure what algorithm "goal seek" employs, but it's most likely a root-finding methods, such as Newton-:spelling:word:`Raphson` or the secant method.
These may fail for a poor choice of starting ``x-value`` or if the formula function has a strange derivative (an odd curvature).
This can be demonstrated by asking "goal seek" to look for an impossible ``x-value``, such as the input that makes ``sqrt(x) == -4``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in goal_seek.py
        try:
            x = Calc.goal_seek(gs=gs, sheet=sheet, cell_name="C1", formula_cell_name="C2", result=-4.0)
            # The formula is still y = sqrt(x)
            # Find x when sqrt(x) == -4, which is impossible
            print(f"x == {x} when sqrt(x) == -4\n")
            
        except GoalDivergenceError as e:
            print(e)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

There's no need to change the starting value in ``C1`` or the formula in ``C2``. The output is:

::

    'Divergence error: 1.7976931348623157e+308'

"Goal seek" can be useful when examining complex equations, such as:

[*** missing formula ***]

What's the ``x-value`` that produces ``y == 2``?

Actually, this equation is simple: is factorized into , and the common factor removed from the fraction; the equation becomes:

So when ``y == 2``, ``x`` will be ``1``.
But let's do things the number-crunching way, and supply the original formula to "goal seek":

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in goal_seek.py
        Calc.set_val(sheet=sheet, cell_name="D1", value=0.8)
        Calc.set_val(sheet=sheet, cell_name="D2", value="=(D1^2 - 1)/(D1 - 1)")
        x = Calc.goal_seek(gs=gs, sheet=sheet, cell_name="D1", formula_cell_name="D2", result=2)
        print(f"x == {x} when x+1 == 2\n")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The printed ``x-value`` is ``1.0000000000000053``

If a formula requires numerical values, they can be supplied as cell references, which allows them to be adjusted easily.
The next "goal seek" example employs an annual interest formula, ``I = x*n*i``, where ``I`` is the annual interest, ``x`` the capital, ``n`` the number of years, and ``i`` the interest rate.
As usual, the ``x-variable`` has a starting value in a cell, but ``n`` and ``i`` are also represented by cells so that they can be changed. The code is:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in goal_seek.py
        Calc.set_val(value=100000, sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1")
        Calc.set_val(value=1, sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")
        Calc.set_val(value=0.075, sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")
        Calc.set_val("=B1*B2*B3", sheet, "B4")
        x = Calc.goal_seek(gs=gs, sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1", formula_cell_name="B4", result=15000)
        print(
            (
                f"x == {x} when x*"
                f'{Calc.get_val(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")}*'
                f'{Calc.get_val(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")}'
                " == 15000\n"
            )
        )

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

"Goal seek" is being asked to determine the x-value when the annual return from the formula is ``20000``.
The values in the cells ``B2`` and ``B3`` are employed, and the printed answer is:

::

    x == 200000.0 when x*1.0*0.075 == 15000

.. _ch27_linear_non_linear_solving:

27.4 Linear and Nonlinear Solving
=================================

Calc supports both linear and nonlinear programming via its Tools -> Solver menu item.
The name "linear programming" dates from just after World War II, and doesn't mean programming in the modern sense;
in fact, it's probably better to use its other common name, "linear optimization".

Linear optimization starts with a series of linear equations involving inequalities, and finds the best numerical values that satisfy the equations according to
a 'profit' equation that must be maximized (or minimized).
Fortunately, this has a very nice graphical representation when the equations only involve two unknowns: the equations cam be drawn as lines crossing the ``x`` and ``y`` axes,
and the best values will be one of the points where the lines intersect.

As you might expect, nonlinear programming (optimization) is a generalization of the linear case where some of the equations are non-linear
(:abbreviation:`i.e.` perhaps they involve polynomials, logarithmic, or trigonometric functions).

A gentle introduction to linear optimization and its graphing can be found at `<https://purplemath.com/modules/linprog.htm>`__,
or you can start at `Wikipedia page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming>`__.

The Calc documentation on linear and nonlinear solving is rather minimal.
There's no mention of it in the Calc Developer's Guide, and just a brief section on its GUI at the end of chapter 9 ("Data Analysis") of the Calc User guide.

The current version of LibreOffice (``ver 7``) offers four optimization tools (called solvers) - two linear optimizers called "LibreOffice Linear Solver" and "LibreOffice CoinMP Linear Solver",
and two nonlinear ones called "DEPS Evolutionary Algorithm" and "SCO Evolutionary Algorithm".
The easiest way of checking the current solver situation in your version of Office is to look at Calc's Solver dialog window (by clicking on the Tools -> Solver menu item),
and click on the "Options" button. The options dialog window lists all the installed solvers, and their numerous parameters, as in :numref:`ch27fig_solvers_and_params`.

..

    .. _ch27fig_solvers_and_params:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/205714788-c1cdc81d-2311-4cfc-afe3-5eeb03f5a108.png
        :alt: The LibreOffice Solvers and their Parameters
        :figclass: align-center

        :The LibreOffice Solvers and their Parameters

Another way of getting a list of the installed solvers, is to call :py:meth:`.Calc.list_solvers`, which is demonstrated in the first example given below.

The two linear solvers are implemented (in Windows) as DLLs, located in the ``\program`` directory as ``lpsolve55.dll`` and ``CoinMP.dll``.
The source code for these libraries is online, at `<https://docs.libreoffice.org/sccomp/html/files.html>`__, with the code (and graphs of the code) accessible via the "Files" tab.
The file names are ``LpsolveSolver.cxx`` and ``CoinMPSolver.cxx``.

The ``lpsolve55.dll`` filename strongly suggests that Office's basic linear solver is ``lp_solve 5.5``, which originates online at `<https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/>`__.
That site has extensive documentation, including a great introduction to linear optimization.
The first programming example below comes from one of the examples in its documentation.

Office's other linear optimizer, the :spelling:word:`CoinMP` solver, comes from the COIN-OR (Computational Infrastructure for Operations Research) open-source project which started at IBM research (`<https://coin-or.org/>`__).
According to `<https://coin-or.org/projects/CoinMP.xml>`__, :spelling:word:`CoinMP` implements most of the functionality of three other COIN-OR projects, called CLP (Coin LP), CBC (Coin Branch-and-Cut), and CGL (Cut Generation Library).

The two nonlinear solvers are known as DEPS and SCO for short, and are explained in the `OpenOffice wiki <https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/NLPSolver>`__, along with descriptions of their extensive (and complicated) parameters.
They're implemented as JAR files, located in LibreOffice's share directory: ``\share\extensions\nlpsolver`` as ``nlpsolver.jar`` and ``EvolutionarySolver.jar``.
Two of the examples below use these solvers.

.. _ch27_linear_opt_propblem:

27.4.1 A Linear Optimization Problem
------------------------------------

The |solve_ex|_ example shows how to use the basic linear solver, and also ``CoinMP``.
It implements the following linear optimization problem, which comes from `<https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.1/formulate.htm>`__.
There are three constraint inequalities:

::

    120x + 210y â‰¤ 15000
    110x + 30y â‰¤ 4000
    x + y â‰¤ 75

The ``profit`` expression to be maximized is:

::

    P = 143x + 60y

The maximum P value is ``6315.625``, when ``x == 21.875`` and ``y == 53.125``.
Perhaps the easiest way of calculating this outside of Office is via the linear optimization tool at `<https://zweigmedia.com/utilities/lpg/index.html?lang=en>`__.
Its solution is shown in :numref:`ch27fig_solved_graphed_lo`.

Aside from giving the answer, the equations are graphed, which shows how the maximum profit is one of the equation's intersection points.

The main() function for |solve_ex_py|_:

                sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc)
                Calc.list_solvers()

                # could also include x >= 0 and y >= 0
                constraints = (sc1, sc2, sc3)

                solver = "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.CoinMPSolver"

                # initialize the linear solver (CoinMP or basic linear)
                solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(XSolver, solver, raise_err=True)
                solver.Document = doc
                solver.Objective = profit_eq
                solver.Variables = vars
                solver.Constraints = constraints
                solver.Maximize = True

                # restrict the search to the top-right quadrant of the graph
                Props.set(solver, NonNegative=True)

                # execute the solver
                solver.solve()

The call to :py:meth:`.Calc.list_solvers` isn't strictly necessary but it provides useful information about the names of the solver services:

::

    Services offered by the solver:
      com.sun.star.comp.Calc.CoinMPSolver
      com.sun.star.comp.Calc.LpsolveSolver
      com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.DEPSSolverImpl
      com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl 
      com.sun.star.comp.Calc.SwarmSolver

One of these names is needed when calling :py:meth:`.Lo.create_instance_mcf` to create a solver instance.

:py:meth:`.Calc.list_solvers` is implemented as:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class
        @staticmethod
        def list_solvers() -> None:
            print("Services offered by the solver:")
            nms = Info.get_service_names(service_name="com.sun.star.sheet.Solver")
            if nms is None:
                print("  none")
                return

            for service in nms:
                print(f"  {service}")
            print()

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The real work of :py:meth:`~.Calc.list_solvers` is done by calling :py:meth:`.Info.get_service_names` which finds all the implementations that support ``com.sun.star.sheet.Solver``.

Back in |solve_ex_py|_, the inequality and profit equations are defined as formulae in a sheet, and the variables in the equations are also assigned to cells.

The two variables in this problem (``x`` and ``y``) are assigned to the cells ``B1`` and ``B2``, and the cell addresses are stored in an array for later:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        xpos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1")  # X
        ypos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")  # Y
        vars = (xpos, ypos)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Next the equations are defined. Their formulae are assigned to cells without their inequality parts:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        # specify profit equation
        Calc.set_val(value="=143*B1 + 60*B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")
        profit_eq = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet, "B3")

        # set up equation formulae without inequalities
        Calc.set_val(value="=120*B1 + 210*B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        Calc.set_val(value="=110*B1 + 30*B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B5")
        Calc.set_val(value="=B1 + B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B6")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Now the three equation formulae are converted into SolverConstraint objects by calling :py:meth:`.Calc.make_constraint`, and the constraints are stored in an array for later use:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        # create the constraints
        # constraints are equations and their inequalities
        sc1 = Calc.make_constraint(num=15000, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        #   20x + 210y <= 15000
        #   B4 is the address of the cell that is constrained
        sc2 = Calc.make_constraint(
            num=4000, op=SolverConstraintOperator.LESS_EQUAL, sheet=sheet, cell_name="B5"
        )
        #   110x + 30y <= 4000
        sc3 = Calc.make_constraint(num=75, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B6")
        #   x + y <= 75

        # could also include x >= 0 and y >= 0
        constraints = (sc1, sc2, sc3)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

A constraint is the cell name where an equation is stored and an inequality.

:py:meth:`.Calc.make_constraint` is defined as:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class (simplified, overlaods)
        @classmethod
        def make_constraint(
            cls, num: numbers.Number, op: str, sheet: XSpreadsheet, cell_name: str
        ) -> SolverConstraint:
            return cls.make_constraint(
                num=num, op=op, addr=cls.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name=cell_name)
            )

        @classmethod
        def make_constraint(
            cls, num: numbers.Number, op: str, addr: CellAddress
        ) -> SolverConstraint:
            return cls.make_constraint(num=num, op=cls.to_constraint_op(op), addr=addr)

        @classmethod
        def make_constraint(
            cls, num: numbers.Number, op: SolverConstraintOperator,
            sheet: XSpreadsheet, cell_name: str
        ) -> SolverConstraint:
            return cls.make_constraint(
                num=num, op=op, addr=cls.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name=cell_name)
            )

        @classmethod
        def make_constraint(
            cls, num: numbers.Number, op: SolverConstraintOperator, addr: CellAddress
        ) -> SolverConstraint:
            sc = SolverConstraint()
            sc.Left = addr
            sc.Operator = op
            sc.Right = float(num)
            return sc

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

    .. seealso::

        .. cssclass:: src-link

            :odev_src_calc_meth:`make_constraint`

That's a lot of functions to create a SolverConstraint object with four arguments.

Now the solver is created, and its parameters are set:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
            XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.LpsolveSolver", raise_err=True
        )
        solver.Document = doc
        solver.Objective = profit_eq
        solver.Variables = vars
        solver.Constraints = constraints
        solver.Maximize = True

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The XSolver_ interface is utilized by all the solvers, but the name of service can vary.
The code above is using the basic linear solver.
A ``CoinMP`` solver would be created by changing ``LpsolveSolver`` to ``CoinMPSolver``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
            XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.CoinMPSolver", raise_err=True
        )

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The various ``set`` methods are described in the XSolver_ documentation as public variables.
They load the profit equation, constraints, and variables into the solver.
It's also necessary to specify that the profit equation be maximized, and link the solver to the Calc document.

These ``set`` methods are used in the same way no matter which of the four solvers is employed.
Where the solvers differ is in their service properties.
As mentioned above, there's a few sources of online information depending on which solver you're using, or you could look at the options dialog window shown in :numref:`ch27fig_solvers_and_params`.

Another source is to call :py:meth:`.Props.show_obj_props` on the solver, to list its property names and current values:
``Props.show_obj_props("Solver", solver)`` When the basic linear solver is being used, the output is:

::

    EpsilonLevel == 0
    Integer == false
    LimitBBDepth == true
    NonNegative == false
    Timeout == 100

This corresponds to the information shown for the basic linear solver in the options dialog in Figure 10.

..

        :figclass: align-center

        :The Options Dialog for the Basic Linear Solver.

As to what these parameters actually mean, you'll have to look through the ``lp_solve`` API reference section of the documentation at `<https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/>`__.
For example, the "epsilon level" is partly explained under the sub-heading ``set_epslevel``.

The only property changed in the |solve_ex_py|_ example is ``NonNegative``, which is set to ``True``:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        # restrict the search to the top-right quadrant of the graph
        Props.set(solver, NonNegative=True)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

This restricts the search for intersection points to the top-right quadrant of the graph.
Alternatively I could have implemented two more constraints:

::

    x â‰¥ 0
    y â‰¥ 0

The solver's results are printed by :py:meth:`.Calc.solver_report`:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in linear_solve.py
        solver.solve()
        Calc.solver_report(solver)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The output:

::

    Solver result: 
      B3 == 6315.6250 
    Solver variables: 
      B1 == 21.8750   
      B2 == 53.1250  

:py:meth:`.Calc.solver_report` is implemented as:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Calc class (simplified)
        @classmethod
        def solver_report(cls, solver: XSolver) -> None:
            is_successful = solver.Success
            cell_name = cls.get_cell_str(solver.Objective)
            print("Solver result: ")
            print(f"  {cell_name} == {solver.ResultValue:.4f}")
            addrs = solver.Variables
            solns = solver.Solution
            print("Solver variables: ")
            for i, num in enumerate(solns):
                cell_name = cls.get_cell_str(addrs[i])
                print(f"  {cell_name} == {num:.4f}")
            print()

``XSolver.Objective`` and ``XSolver.Variables`` return the cell addresses holding the profit equation and the variables (``x`` and ``y``).
In a corresponding fashion, ``XSolver.ResultValue`` and ``XSolver.Solution`` return the calculated values for the profit equation and variables.

A solver may fail, and so :py:meth:`~.Calc.solver_report` first calls ``XSolver.Success``.

27.4.2 Another Linear Problem (using SCO)
-----------------------------------------

Two examples are coded using the nonlinear optimizers - |nl_solve_ex1_py|_ utilizes the SCO solver, and |nl_solve_ex2_py|_ employs DEPS.
As I mentioned earlier, these two solvers are explained at `<https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/NLPSolver>`__.

The |nl_solve_ex1_py|_ example solves a linear problem, but one involving three unknowns.
This means that graphically the equations define planes in a 3D space, and solving the profit equation involves examining the corners of the volume defined by how the planes intersect.
Unfortunately, the `<https://zweigmedia.com/utilities/lpg/index.html?lang=en>`__ website cannot handle linear optimizations involving more than two variables, but no such restriction applies to Calc's solvers.

There are three constraint inequalities:

::

    x â‰¤ 6
    y â‰¤ 8
    z â‰¥ 4

The 'profit' expression to be maximized is:

::

    P = x + y - z
    The maximum P value is 10, when x == 6, y == 8, and z == 4.

Much of ``main()`` in |nl_solve_ex1_py|_ is very similar to |solve_ex|_:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # part of main() in solver1.py
        sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc)

        # specify the variable cells
        xpos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1")  # X
        ypos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")  # Y
        zpos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")  # z
        vars = (xpos, ypos, zpos)

        # set up equation formula without inequality
        Calc.set_val(value="=B1+B2-B3", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        objective = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet, "B4")

        # create three constraints (using the 3 variables)

        sc1 = Calc.make_constraint(num=6, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1")
        #   x <= 6
        sc2 = Calc.make_constraint(num=8, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")
        #   y <= 8
        sc3 = Calc.make_constraint(num=4, op=">=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")
        #   z >= 4

        constraints = (sc1, sc2, sc3)

        # initialize the nonlinear solver (SCO)
        solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
            XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl", raise_err=True
        )
        solver.Document = doc
        solver.Objective = objective
        solver.Variables = vars
        solver.Constraints = constraints
        solver.Maximize = True

        # restrict the search to the top-right quadrant of the graph
        Props.show_obj_props("Solver", solver)
        # switch off nonlinear dialog about current progress
        Props.set(solver, EnhancedSolverStatus=False)

        # execute the solver
        solver.solve()
        # Profit max == 10; vars are very close to 6, 8, and 4, but off by 6-7 dps
        Calc.solver_report(solver)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Only the profit formula needs to be assigned to a cell due to the simplicity of the equation inequalities.
Their constraints can use the cells containing the ``x``, ``y``, and ``z`` variables rather than be defined as separate formulae.

The Solver is ``com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl``, whose name was found by listing the solver names with :py:meth:`.Calc.list_solvers`.

The properties associated with the SCO solver are more extensive than for the linear solvers.
:py:meth:`.Props.show_obj_props` reports:

::

These can also be viewed via the Options dialog in the Calc GUI, as in :numref:`ch27fig_opt_dialog_for_sco_solver`.

These parameters, most of which apply to the DEPS solver as well, are explained at `<https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/NLPSolver#Options_and_Parameters>`__.

The correct solution reported by :py:meth:`.Calc.solver_report` is:

::

    Solver result: 
      B4 == 10.0000
    Solver variables:
      B1 == 6.0000
      B2 == 8.0000
      B3 == 4.0000

.. _ch27_nonlinear_prob_deps_sco:

27.4.3 A Nonlinear Problem (using DEPS and SCO)
===============================================

|nl_solve_ex2_py|_ defines a nonlinear optimization problem, so can only be solved by the DEPS or SCO solver; starting with DEPS.

The problem comes from the `Wikipedia page on nonlinear programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming>`_.
There are four constraint inequalities:

::

    x â‰¥ 0
    y â‰¥ 0
    x
    2
     + y
    2
     â‰¥ 1
    x
    2
     + y
    2
     â‰¤ 2

The 'profit' expression to be maximized is:

::

    P = x + y

The maximum ``P`` value is ``2``, when ``x == 1`` and ``y == 1``, which can be represented graphically in :numref:`ch27fig_sol_nonlinear_opt_prob` since we're once again using only two unknowns.

The code in |nl_solve_ex2_py|_ is only slightly different from the previous two examples:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # part of main() in solver2.py
        sheet = Calc.get_sheet(doc=doc)

        # specify the variable cells
        xpos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B1")  # X
        ypos = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet=sheet, cell_name="B2")  # Y
        vars = (xpos, ypos)

        # specify profit equation
        Calc.set_val(value="=B1+B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B3")
        objective = Calc.get_cell_address(sheet, "B3")

        # set up equation formula without inequality (only one needed)
        # x^2 + y^2
        Calc.set_val(value="=B1*B1 + B2*B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")

        # create three constraints (using the 3 variables)

        sc1 = Calc.make_constraint(num=1, op=">=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        #   x^2 + y^2 >= 1
        sc2 = Calc.make_constraint(num=2, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        #   x^2 + y^2 <= 2

        constraints = (sc1, sc2)

        # initialize the nonlinear solver (SCO)
        solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
            XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl", raise_err=True
        )
        solver.Document = doc
        solver.Objective = objective
        solver.Variables = vars
        solver.Constraints = constraints
        solver.Maximize = True

        Props.show_obj_props("Solver", solver)
        # switch off nonlinear dialog about current progress
        # and restrict the search to the top-right quadrant of the graph
        Props.set(solver, EnhancedSolverStatus=False, AssumeNonNegative=True)

        # execute the solver
        solver.solve()
        Calc.solver_report(solver)


    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Only one inequality equation is defined: ``Calc.set_val(value="=B1*B1 + B2*B2", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")`` because it can be used twice to define the nonlinear constraints:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        sc1 = Calc.make_constraint(num=1, op=">=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        #   x^2 + y^2 >= 1
        sc2 = Calc.make_constraint(num=2, op="<=", sheet=sheet, cell_name="B4")
        #   x^2 + y^2 <= 2

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

No constraints are defined for ``x >= 0`` and ``y >= 0``.
Instead, the solver's ``AssumeNonNegative`` property is set to ``True``, which achieves the same thing.

The DEPS solver is used by default when a nonlinear optimization needs to be solved,
so the solver is instantiated using the general Solver service name:
``solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl", raise_err=True)``
Alternatively, it's possible to use the DEPS service name: ``com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.DEPSSolverImpl``

The results printed by :py:meth:`.Calc.solver_report` are:

::

    Solver result: 
      B3 == 2.0000
    Solver variables:
      B1 == 1.0001
      B2 == 0.9999

If DEPS is replaced by the SCO solver:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        solver = Lo.create_instance_mcf(
            XSolver, "com.sun.star.comp.Calc.NLPSolver.SCOSolverImpl", raise_err=True
        )

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The printed result is slightly more accurate:

::

    Solver result:
      B3 == 2.0000
    Solver variables:
      B1 == 1.0000
      B2 == 1.0000

but it takes a little bit longer to return.
