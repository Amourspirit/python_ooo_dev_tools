    Window Listeners;

This chapter concludes the general introduction to Office programming by looking at several techniques that will reappear periodically in later chapters: the use of window listeners.

1. Listening to a Window
========================

Probably the easiest way of obtaining a list of them all is to visit the LibreOffice documentation for XEventListener_ (use ``lodoc XEventListener``).
The tree diagram at the top of the page shows that every listener interface is a subclass of XEventListener_, and you can click on a subclass box to jump to its documentation.

One nice syntactic feature of listeners is that almost all their names end with “Listener”.
This makes them easy to find when searching through indices of class names, such as the `Class Index <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/classes.html>`_.
