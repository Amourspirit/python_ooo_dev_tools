:ref:`ch01` introduced some of the core ideas of Office.
Now it's time to show how these data structures and relationships (e.g. service, interfaces, FCM, inheritance)
are programmed in |app_name_bold| (|odev|) API.

This chapter will focus on the most fundamental tasks: starting Office,
loading (or creating) a document, saving and closing the document, and shutting down Office.

Some the examples come from the `LibreOffice Python UNO Examples <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-ooouno-ex>`_ project.

The aim with these |odev| is to hide some of the verbiage of Office.
When (if?) a programmer feels ready for more detail, then my code is documented.
Here, only explaining functions that illustrate Office ideas, such as service managers and components.

This is the first chapter with code, and so the first where programs could crash! Section 8 gives a few tips on bug detection and reporting.

.. _ch02_starting_office:

2.1 Starting Office
===================

Every program must load Office before working with a document (unless run in a macro), and shut it down before exiting.
These tasks are handled by :py:meth:`.Lo.load_office` and :py:meth:`.Lo.close_office` from the ::py:class:`.Lo`.
A typical program will look like the following:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        from ooodev.utils.lo import Lo

        def main() -> None:
            loader = Lo.load_office(Lo.ConnectSocket(headless=True)) # XComponentLoader

            # load, manipulate and close a document

            Lo.close_office()

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            main()

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

``Lo.load_office(Lo.ConnectSocket(headless=True))`` invokes Office and sets up a UNO bridge using named pipes with a headless connection.
If not using the Graphic User Interface (GUI) of LibreOffice then ``headless=True`` is recommended.
See example |extract_graphics_py|_.

There is also ``Lo.load_office(Lo.ConnectPipes(headless=True))`` which uses which uses pipes instead of sockets.
See example |extract_txt_py|_.

For convenience ``Lo.ConnectPipe`` is an alias of :py:class:`~.conn.connectors.ConnectPipe`
and ``Lo.ConnectSocket`` is an alias of :py:class:`~.conn.connectors.ConnectSocket`.

In both cases, a remote component context is created (see Chapter 1, :numref:`ch01fig_python_using_office`) and then a service manager,
Desktop object, and component loader are initialized.
Below is a simplified version of :py:meth:`.Lo.load_office`, that show the principle of connecting to LibreOffice.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Lo class (simplified)
        @classmethod
        def load_office(
            cls, connector: ConnectPipe | ConnectSocket | None = None, cache_obj: Cache | None = None
        ) -> XComponentLoader:
    
            Lo.print("Loading Office...")
            if connector is None:
                try:
                    cls._lo_inst = LoDirectStart()
                    cls._lo_inst.connect()
                except Exception as e:
                    Lo.print((
                        "Office context could not be created."
                        " A connector must be supplied if not running as a macro"
                    ))
                    Lo.print(f"    {e}")
                    raise SystemExit(1)
            elif isinstance(connector, ConnectPipe):
                try:
                    cls._lo_inst = LoPipeStart(connector=connector, cache_obj=cache_obj)
                    cls._lo_inst.connect()
                except Exception as e:
                    Lo.print("Office context could not be created")
                    Lo.print(f"    {e}")
                    raise SystemExit(1)
            elif isinstance(connector, ConnectSocket):
                try:
                    cls._lo_inst = LoSocketStart(connector=connector, cache_obj=cache_obj)
                    cls._lo_inst.connect()
                except Exception as e:
                    Lo.print("Office context could not be created")
                    Lo.print(f"    {e}")
                    raise SystemExit(1)
            else:
                Lo.print("Invalid Connector type. Fatal Error.")
                raise SystemExit(1)

            cls._xcc = cls._lo_inst.ctx
            cls._mc_factory = cls._xcc.getServiceManager()
            if cls._mc_factory is None:
                Lo.print("Office Service Manager is unavailable")
                raise SystemExit(1)
            cls._xdesktop = cls.create_instance_mcf(XDesktop, "com.sun.star.frame.Desktop")
            if cls._xdesktop is None:
                Lo.print("Could not create a desktop service")
                raise SystemExit(1)
            loader = cls.qi(XComponentLoader, cls._xdesktop)
            if loader is None:
                Lo.print("Unable to access XComponentLoader")
                SystemExit(1)
            return loader

There is also :py:class:`.Lo.Loader` context manager that allows for automatic closing of office.
See |convert_doc|_ for an example.


It is also simple to start LibreOffice from the command line automate tasks and leave it open for user input.
See `Calc Add Range of Data Automation <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python-ooouno-ex/tree/main/ex/auto/calc/odev_add_range_data>`_ for an example.

There is of course running as a macro as well.

Running a project with several modules can be a bit daunting task.
For this reason oooscript_ was created, which can easily pack several scripts into one script and embed the result into a LibreOfice Document.

The easiest way to run a several module/class project in LibreOffice is to pack into a single script first.
Many examples can be found on |lo_uno_ex|_,
such as |lo_uno_calc_ex|_, |lo_uno_sudoku|_, |lo_uno_tab_control|_.

.. seealso::

    :py:class:`~.utils.session.Session` and |lo_uno_shared_acc|_

Macros only need use use ``Lo.ThisComponent`` as show below.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        from ooodev.utils.lo import Lo
        from ooodev.office.calc import Calc

        def main():
            # get access to current Calc Document
            doc = Calc.get_ss_doc(Lo.ThisComponent)

            # get access to current spreadsheet
            sheet = Calc.get_active_sheet(doc=doc)

            .. group-tab:: None

:py:meth:`.Lo.load_office` probably illustrates my most significant coding decisions – the use of global static variables inside the :py:class:`~.lo.Lo` class.
In particular, the XComponentContext_, XDesktop_, and XMultiComponentFactory_ objects created by :py:meth:`~.lo.Lo.load_office` are stored globally for later use.
This approach is chosen since it allows other support functions to be called with simpler arguments because the objects can be accessed without
the user having to explicitly pass around references to them.
The main drawback is that if ``load_office()`` is called more than once all previous :py:class:`~.lo.Lo` class globals are overwritten.

The creation of the XDesktop_ interface object uses :py:meth:`.Lo.create_instance_mcf`:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # in Lo class
        @classmethod
        def create_instance_mcf(
            cls,
            atype: Type[T], service_name: str,
            args: Tuple[Any, ...] | None = None,
            raise_err: bool = False
        ) -> T | None:

            if cls._xcc is None or cls._mc_factory is None:
                raise Exception("No office connection found")
            try:
                if args is not None:
                    obj = cls._mc_factory.createInstanceWithArgumentsAndContext(
                        service_name, args, cls._xcc
                    )
                else:
                    obj = cls._mc_factory.createInstanceWithContext(service_name, cls._xcc)
                if raise_err is True and obj is None:
                    CreateInstanceMcfError(atype, service_name)
                interface_obj = cls.qi(atype=atype, obj=obj)
                if raise_err is True and interface_obj is None:
                    raise MissingInterfaceError(atype)
                return interface_obj
            except CreateInstanceMcfError:
                raise
            except MissingInterfaceError:
                raise
            except Exception as e:
                raise Exception(f"Couldn't create interface for '{service_name}'") from e

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

If you ignore the error-checking, :py:meth:`.Lo.create_instance_mcf` does two things.
The call to `XMultiComponentFactory.createInstanceWithContext() <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/interfacecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1lang_1_1XMultiComponentFactory.html#ac62a80213fcf269e7a881abc6fa3e6d2>`_
asks the service manager (``cls._mc_factory``) to create a service object inside the remote component context (``cls._xcc``). Then the call to ``uno_obj.queryInterface()``
via :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` looks inside the service instance for the specified interface (``atype``), returning an instance of the interface as its result.

The :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` function's reduces programmer typing, since calls to ``uno_obj.queryInterface()`` are very common in this frame work.
Querying for the interface has the huge advantage of providing typing :numref:`ch02fig_lo_qi_auto_demo` (autocomplete, static type checking) support thanks to types-unopy_.

                : :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` autocomplete demo


The use of generics makes :py:meth:`.Lo.create_instance_mcf` useful for creating any type of interface object.
Unfortunately, generics aren't utilized in the Office API, which relies instead on Object, Office's Any class, or the XInterface class which is inherited by all interfaces.

.. _ch02_clossing_office:

2.2 Closing Down/Killing Office
===============================

:py:meth:`Lo.close_office` shuts down Office by calling ``terminate()`` on the XDesktop_ instance created inside :py:meth:`.Lo.load_office`:
``boolean isDead = xDesktop.terminate()`` This is usually sufficient but occasionally it necessary to delay the ``terminate()`` call for a
few milliseconds in order to give Office components time to finish.
As a consequence, :py:meth:`Lo.close_office` may actually call ``terminate()`` a few times, until it returns ``True``.


While developing/debugging code, it's quite easy to inadvertently trigger a runtime exception in the Office API.
In the worst case, this can cause your program to exit without calling :py:meth:`Lo.close_office`.
This will leave an extraneous Office process running in the OS, which should be killed. The easiest way is with |dsearch|_
``loproc --kill``.

.. _ch02_open_doc:

2.3 Opening a Document
======================

The general format of a program that opens a document, manipulates it in some way, and then saves it, is:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        def main() -> None:
            fnm = sys.argv[1:] # get file from first args

            loader = Lo.load_office(Lo.ConnectSocket(headless=True))
            doc = Lo.open_doc(fnm=fnm, loader=loader)

            # use the Office API to manipulate doc...
            Lo.save_doc(doc, "foo.docx") # save as a Word file
            Lo.close_doc(doc)
            lo.close_office()

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

See |convert_doc|_ for an example.

The new methods are :py:meth:`.Lo.open_doc`, :py:meth:`.Lo.save_doc`, and :py:meth:`.Lo.close_doc`.

:py:meth:`.Lo.open_doc` calls `XComponentLoader.loadComponentFromURL() <https://api.libreoffice.org/docs/idl/ref/interfacecom_1_1sun_1_1star_1_1frame_1_1XComponentLoader.html#a6f89db7d45da267af47d1acf01cd986d>`_,
which requires a document URL, the type of Office frame used to display the document, optional search flags, and an array of document properties.

For example:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        file_url = FileIO.fnm_to_url(fnm)
        props = Props.make_props(Hidden=True)
        doc = loader.loadComponentFromURL(file_url, "_blank", 0, props)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The frame type is almost always "_blank" which indicates that a new window will be created for the newly loaded document.
(Other possibilities are listed in the XComponentLoader_ documentation which you can access with ``lodoc XComponentLoader``.)
The search flags are usually set to 0, and document properties are stored in the PropertyValue_ tuple, props.

``loadComponentFromURL()``'s return type is XComponent_, which refers to the document.

:py:meth:`.FileIO.fnm_to_url` converts an ordinary filename (e.g. “foo.doc”) into a URL (a full path prefixed with ``file:///``).

:py:meth:`.Props.make_props` takes a property name and value and returns a PropertyValue_ tuple; there are several variants which accept different numbers of property name - value pairs.

A complete list of document properties can be found in the MediaDescriptor documentation (accessed with ``lodoc MediaDescriptor service``),
but some of the important ones are listed in :numref:`ch02tbl_some_doc_prop`

2.4 Creating a Document
=======================

The general format of a program that creates a new document, manipulates it in some way, and then saves it, is:

.. include:: ../../resources/odev/02/create_save_tab.rst

A new document is created by calling ``XComponentLoader.loadComponentFromURL()`` with a special URL string for the document type.
The possible strings are listed in :numref:`ch02tbl_new_doc_url`.

For instance, a Writer document is created by:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        doc = loader.loadComponentFromURL("private:factory/swriter", "_blank", 0, props)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

The office classes include code for simplifying the creation of Writer, Draw, Impress, Calc, and Base documents, which I'll be looking at in later chapters.

.. _ch02_second_srv_mgr:

A Second Service Manager
------------------------

:py:meth:`.Lo.open_doc` and :py:meth:`.Lo.create_doc` do a bit of additional work after document loading/creation – they instantiate a
XMultiServiceFactory_ service manager which is stored in the :py:class:`~.lo.Lo` class. This is done by applying :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` to the document:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        # _ms_factory global in Lo
        doc = loader.loadComponentFromURL("private:factory/swriter", "_blank", 0, props)
        Lo._ms_factory =  Lo.qi(XMultiServiceFactory, doc)

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

First :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` is employed in :py:meth:`~.lo.Lo.create_instance_mcf` to access an interface inside a service.
This time :py:meth:`~.lo.Lo.qi` is casting one interface (XComponent_) to another (XMultiServiceFactory_).

The XMultiServiceFactory_ object is the second service manager we've encountered; the first was an XMultiComponentFactory_ instance, created during Office's loading.

The reasons for Office having two service managers are historical:
the XMultiServiceFactory_ manager is older, and creates a service object without the need for an explicit reference to the remote component context.

As Office developed, it was decided that service object creation should always be relative to an explicit component context,
and so the newer XMultiComponentFactory_ service manager came into being.
A lot of older code still uses the XMultiServiceFactory_ service manager, so both are supported in the :py:class:`~.lo.Lo` class.

Another difference between the managers is that the XMultiComponentFactory_ manager is available as soon as Office is loaded,
while the XMultiServiceFactory_ manager is initialized only when a document is loaded or created.

.. _ch02_save_doc:

2.5 Saving a Document
=====================

The general format of a program that creates a new document, manipulates it in some way, and then saves it, is:

.. include:: ../../resources/odev/02/create_save_tab.rst

One of the great strengths of Office is that it can export a document in a vast number of formats,
but the programmer must specify the output format (which is called a filter in the Office documentation).

|storeToURL|_ takes the name of the output file (in URL format), and an array of properties, one of which should be "FilterName".
Two other useful output properties are "Overwrite" and "Password".
Input and output document properties are listed in the MediaDescriptor service documentation (``lodoc MediaDescriptor service``).

If "Overwrite" is set to true then the file will be saved without prompting the user if the file already exists.
The "Password" property contains a string which must be entered into an Office dialog by the user before the file can be opened again.

The steps in saving a file are:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        save_file_url = FileIO.fnm_to_url(fnm)
        store_props = Props.make_props(Overwrite=True, FilterName=format, Password=password)

        store = Lo.qi(XStorable, doc)
        store.storeToURL(save_file_url, store_props);

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

If you don't want a password, then the third property should be left out.
:py:meth:`.Lo.qi` is used again to cast an interface, this time from XComponent_ to |XStorable|_.

:numref:`ch01fig_office_doc_serv` in :ref:`Chapter 1 <ch01>` shows that |XStorable|_ is part of the OfficeDocument service,
which means that it's inherited by all Office document types.

.. _ch02_what_filter_name:

What's a Filter Name?
---------------------

|storeToURL|_ needs a "FilterName" property value, but what should the string be to export the document in Word format for example?

:py:meth:`.Info.get_filter_names` returns an array of all the filter names supported by Office.

Rather than force a programmer to search through this list for the correct name, :py:meth:`.Lo.save_doc`
allows him to supply just the name and extension of the output file. For example,
in :ref:`ch02_open_doc`, :py:meth:`.Lo.save_doc` was called like so:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        Lo.save_doc(doc, "foo.docx") # save as a Word file

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

:py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc` extracts the file extension (i.e. "docx") and maps it to a corresponding filter name in Office
(in this case, "Office Open XML Text"). One concern is that it's not always clear which extension-to-filter mapping should be utilized.
For instance, another suitable filter name for "docx" is "MS Word 2007 XML".
This problem is essentially ignored, by hard wiring a fixed selection into :py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc`.

Another issue is that the choice of filter sometimes depends on the extension and the document type.
For example, a Writer document saved as a PDF file should use the filter ``writer_pdf_Export``,
but if the document is a spreadsheet then ``calc_pdf_Export`` is the correct choice.

:py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc` get document type from :py:meth:`.Info.report_doc_type` that calls :py:meth:`.Info.is_doc_type`
to examine the document's service name which is accessed via the XServiceInfo_ interface:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        xinfo = Lo.qi(XServiceInfo, doc)
        is_writer = xinfo.supportsService("com.sun.star.text.TextDocument")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

Then :py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc` utilizes :py:meth:`~.Lo.ext_to_format` to get document extension.

The main document service names are listed in :numref:`ch02tbl_doc_service_names`.
For quick access in your scripts use :py:class:`.Lo.Service` where applicable.

.. _ch02tbl_doc_service_names:

.. table:: Document Service Names.
    :name: doc_service_names

    =========== ==================================================
    Document    Type Service Name                                 
    =========== ==================================================
    Writer      ``com.sun.star.text.TextDocument``                
    Draw        ``com.sun.star.drawing.DrawingDocument``          
    Impress     ``com.sun.star.presentation.PresentationDocument``
    Calc        ``com.sun.star.sheet.SpreadsheetDocument``        
    Base        ``com.sun.star.sdb.OfficeDatabaseDocument``       
    =========== ==================================================


We encountered these service names back in :ref:`Chapter 1 <ch01>`, :numref:`ch01fig_office_doc_super` – they're
sub-classes of the ``OfficeDocument`` service.


A third problem is incompleteness; :py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc` via :py:meth:`~.Lo.ext_to_format` mappings only implements a small subset
of Office's 250+ filter names, so if you try to save a file with an exotic extension then the code will most likely break.
:py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc` has an overload that takes format as option, that is a filter name.
This overload can be used to if a filter is not implements by :py:meth:`~.Lo.ext_to_format`.

If you want to study the details, start with :py:meth:`~.Lo.save_doc`, and burrow down; the trickiest part is :py:meth:`~.Lo.ext_to_format`.

.. _ch02_close_doc:

2.6 Closing a Document
======================

Closing a document is a pain if you want to check with the user beforehand: should a modified file be saved, thereby overwriting the old version?
|odev|'s solution is not to bother the user, so the file is closed without saving, irrespective of any modifications.
In other words, it's essential to explicitly save a changed document with :py:meth:`.Lo.save_doc` before calling :py:meth:`.Lo.close_doc`.

The code for closing employs :py:meth:`.Lo.qi` to cast the document's XComponent_ interface to XCloseable_:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        closeable =  Lo.qi(XCloseable.class, doc)
        closeable.close(false)  # doc. closed without saving

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

.. _ch02_gen_purpose_convert:

2.7 A General Purpose Converter
===============================

The |convert_doc|_ example in takes two command line arguments: the name of an input file and the extension that should be used when saving the loaded document.
For instance:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        python -m doc_convertor --ext 'odp' --file 'points.ppt'

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

will save slides in MS PowerPoint format as an Impress presentation.

The following converts a JPEG image into PNG:

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python
    
        python -m doc_convertor --ext 'png' --file 'skinner.jpg'

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

|convert_doc_src|_ is relatively short. Here is the main section.

.. tabs::

    .. code-tab:: python

        with Lo.Loader(Lo.ConnectSocket(headless=True)) as loader:
            # get the absolute path of input file
            p_fnm = FileIO.get_absolute_path(args.file_path)

            name = Info.get_name(p_fnm)  # get name part of file without ext
            if not ext.startswith("."):
                # just in case user did not include . in --ext value
                ext = "." + ext

            p_save = Path(p_fnm.parent, f"{name}{ext}")  # new file, same as old file but different ext

            doc = Lo.open_doc(fnm=p_fnm, loader=loader)
            Lo.save_doc(doc=doc, fnm=p_save)
            Lo.close_doc(doc)

        print(f"All done! converted file: {p_save}")

    .. only:: html

        .. cssclass:: tab-none

            .. group-tab:: None

.. _ch02_bug_detection:

2.8 Bug Detection and Reporting
===============================

This chapter began our coding with the Office API, and so the possibility of bugs also becomes an issue.
If you find a problem with |odev| classes then please `submit an issue <https://github.com/Amourspirit/python_ooo_dev_tools/issues>`_.
supplying as much detail as possible.

Another source of bugs is the LibreOffice API itself, which is hardly a surprise considering its complexity and age.
If you find a problem, then you should first search LibreOffice's `Bugzilla site <https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/>`_
to see if the problem has been reported previously (it probably has). Various types of search are explained in the
`Bugzilla documentation <https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/docs/en/html/using/>`_.
If you want to report a new bug, then you'll need to set up an account, which is quite simple, and also explained by the documentation.

Often when people report bugs they don't include enough information, perhaps because the error window displayed by Windows is somewhat lacking.
For example, a typical crash report window is show in :numref:`ch02fig_crash_report`.

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch02fig_crash_report:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/178563937-ce136961-4d80-4abf-9a61-f936d30a727b.png
        :alt: The LibreOffice Crash Reported by Windows 7.
        :figclass: align-center

        :The LibreOffice Crash Reported by Windows 7.

If you're going to make an official report, you should first read the article `How to Report Bugs in LibreOffice <https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/QA/BugReport>`_.

Expert forum members and Bugzilla maintainers sometimes point people towards WinDbg for Windows as a tool for producing good debugging details. The wiki has a `detailed explanation <https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/How_to_get_a_backtrace_with_WinDbg>`_
of how to install and use it , which is a bit scary in its complexity.

A much easier alternative is the `WinCrashReport <https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/application_crash_report.html>` application from NirSoft_.

It presents the Windows Error Reporting (WER) data generated by a crash in a readable form.

When a crash window appears (like the one in :numref:`ch02fig_crash_report`), start WinCrashReport to examine the automatically-generated error report, as in :numref:`ch02fig_win_crash_rpt_gui`.

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch02fig_win_crash_rpt_gui:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/178566048-95c4d2f5-76c5-4ec5-9ba8-bc7d880b35ef.png
        :alt: Win Crash Report GUI
        :figclass: align-center

        :Win Crash Report GUI

:numref:`ch02fig_win_crash_rpt_gui` indicates that the problem lies inside ``mergedlo.dll``, an access violation (the exception code ``0xC0000005``) to a memory address.

`mergedlo.dll` is part of LibreOffice which probably means that you can find the DLL in /program.
Most Office DLLs are located in that directory.

``WinCrashReport`` generates two alternative call stacks, with slightly more information in the second in this case.
``mergedlo.dll`` is called by the ``uno_getCurrentEnvironment()`` function in ``cppu3.dll``, as indicated in :numref:`ch02fig_sec_call_stack_rpt`.

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch02fig_sec_call_stack_rpt:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/178566993-99c82ab5-ca0b-483b-b42f-8527673aeb09.png

This narrows the problem to a specific function and two DLLs, which is very helpful.

If you want to better understand the DLLs, they can be examined using `DLL Export Viewer <https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/dll_export_viewer.html>`_
, another NirSoft_ tool, which lists a DLL's exported functions. Running it on `mergedlo.dll` turns up nothing, but the details for `cppu3.dll` are shown in :numref:`ch02fig_dll_export_view`.

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch02fig_dll_export_view:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/178568452-ac8bf39f-a026-4260-bd32-a66ffb6deded.png
        :alt: DLL Export Viewer's view of cppu3.dll
        :figclass: align-center

        :DLL Export Viewer's view of ``cppu3.dll``

``mergedlo.dll`` appears to be empty inside DLL Export Viewer because it exports no functions.
That probably means it's being used as a store for resources, such as icons, cursors, and images.
There's another NirSoft_ tool for looking at DLL resources, called `ResourcesExtract <https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/resources_extract.html>`_
for searching the gigantic code base. :numref:`ch02fig_open_grok_result` shows the results for an ``uno_getCurrentEnvironment`` search.

.. cssclass:: screen_shot invert

    .. _ch02fig_open_grok_result:
    .. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4193389/178569089-5d836f83-458a-49ca-bd90-1614ffc4a86b.png
        :alt: OpenGrok Results for "uno_getCurrentEnvironment"
        :figclass: align-center

        : ``OpenGrok`` Results for ``uno_getCurrentEnvironment``

The function's code is in EnvStack.cxx, which can be examined by clicking on the linked function name shown at the bottom of :numref:`ch02fig_open_grok_result`.
