    Examining Office; Getting and Setting Document Properties; Examining a Document for API Details; Examining a Document Using |devtools|_

This chapter looks at ways to examine the state of the Office application and a document.
A document will be examined in three different ways: the first retrieves properties about the file, such as its author, keywords,
and when it was last modified. The second and third approaches extract API details, such as what services and interfaces it uses.
This can be done by calling functions in my Utils class or by utilizing the |devtools|_ built into Office.

3.1 Examining Office
====================

It's sometimes necessary to examine the state of the Office application, for example to determine its version number or installation directory.
There are two main ways of finding this information, using configuration properties and path settings.

3.1.1 Examining Configuration Properties
----------------------------------------

.. todo:: 

    Chapter 3, Link to chapter 15

Configuration management is a complex area, which is explained reasonably well in chapter 15 of the developer's guide and online at
OpenOffice |ooconfigmanage|_; Only basics are explained here.
The easiest way of accessing the relevant online section is by typing: ``loguide "Configuration Management"``.

Office stores a large assortment of XML configuration data as ".xcd" files in the \\share \\registry directory.
They can be programatically accessed in three steps: first a ConfigurationProvider service is created, which represents the configuration database tree.
The tree is examined with a ConfigurationAccess service which is supplied with the path to the node of interest.
Configuration properties can be accessed by name with the XNameAccess interface.


These steps are hidden inside :py:meth:`.Info.get_config` which requires at most two arguments â€“ the path to the required node,
and the name of the property inside that node.

The two most useful paths seem to be ``/org.openoffice.Setup/Product`` and ``/org.openoffice.Setup/L10N``,
which are hardwired as constants in the :py:class:`~.utils.info.Info` class. The simplest version of :py:meth:`~.utils.info.Info.get_config`
looks along both paths by default so the programmer only has to supply a property name when calling the method

This is illustrated in the OfficeInfo.java example in the |oinfo|_:

Many other property names, which don't seem that useful, are documented with the :py:class:`~.info.Info` class.
One way of finding the most current list is to browse `main.xcd` in ``\share\registry``.

            print(f"\nOffice Name: {Info.get_config('ooName')}")
            print(f"\nOffice version (long): {Info.get_config('ooSetupVersionAboutBox')}")
            print(f"Office version (short): {Info.get_config('ooSetupVersion')}")
            print(f"\nOffice language location: {Info.get_config('ooLocale')}")
            print(f"System language location: {Info.get_config('ooSetupSystemLocale')}")

            print(f"\nFilters Dir: {Info.get_paths('Filter')}")
            print(f"\nTemplates Dirs: {Info.get_paths('Template')}")
            print(f"\nGallery Dir: {Info.get_paths('Gallery')}")

3.1.2 Examining Path Settings
-----------------------------

Path settings store directory locations for parts of the Office installation, such as the whereabouts of the gallery and spellchecker files.
A partial list of predefined paths is accessible from within LibreOffice, via the Tools menu: Tools, Options, LibreOffice, Paths.
But the best source of information is the developer's guide, in the "Path Organization" section of chapter 6, or at
OpenOffice |pathorg|_, which can be accessed using: ``loguide "Path Organization"``

One issue is that path settings comes in two forms: a string holding a single directory path, or a string made up of a
``;`` - separated paths. Additionally, the directories are returned in URI format (i.e. they start with ``file:///``).


:py:meth:`.Info.get_paths` hides the creation of a PathSettings service, and the accessing of its properties.

Probably the most common Office forum question about paths is how to determine Office's installation directory.
Unfortunately, that isn't one of the paths stored in the PathSettings service, but the information is accessible
via one of the other paths. It's possible to retrieve the path for AddIns (which is \\program\\addin), and move up
the directory hierarchy two levels. This trick is implemented by :py:meth:`.Info.get_office_dir`.

Examples of using :py:meth:`.Info.get_office_dir` and :py:meth:`.Info.get_paths` appear in |oinfo|_:

    .. code-tab:: python

        print(f"\nOffice Dir: {Info.get_office_dir()}")
        print(f"\nAddin Dir: {Info.get_paths('Addin')}")
        print(f"\nFilters Dir: {Info.get_paths('Filter')}")
        print(f"\nTemplates Dirs: {Info.get_paths('Template')}")
        print(f"\nGallery Dir: {Info.get_paths('Gallery')}")


3.2 Getting and Setting Document Properties
===========================================

Document properties is the information that's displayed when you right-click on a file icon, and select "Properties" from the menu, as in :numref:`ch03fig01`.

        :A Properties Dialog in Windows 10 for "algs.odp".

If you select the "Details" tab, a list of properties appears like those in :numref:`ch03fig02`.

        :Details Properties List for "algs.odp".

An issue with document properties is that the Office API for manipulating them has changed.
The old interfaces were XDocumentInfoSupplier_ and XDocumentInfo_, but these have been deprecated, and replaced by
XDocumentPropertiesSupplier_ and XDocumentProperties_. This wouldn't really matter except that while OpenOffice retains those deprecated interfaces,
LibreOffice has removed them.
