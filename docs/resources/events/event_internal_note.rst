.. note::

    Events are limited to |odev|.

    For instance |odev| can capture when are row is being removed from a spreadsheet
    internally; However, |odev| is not aware when other methods are used such as user input.

    For more indepth Events look into LibreOffice Listeners and :ref:`ch04`.
