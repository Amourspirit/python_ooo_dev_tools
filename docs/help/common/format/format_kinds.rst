Formatting and Styling kinds
============================

|odev| :py:mod:`ooodev.formats` provides a set of classes and functions to format and style text and documents.

There are three types of formatting and styling: ``direct``, ``modify`` and ``style``.

Direct formatting applies changes directly to an object.
Much like setting a selection of text to bold or italic in LibreOffice Writer. See :ref:`help_writer_format_direct_char_font_effects` as an example.

Modify formatting applies changes to a style in the document. Such a character style or a paragraph style. See :ref:`help_writer_format_modify_para_color` as an example.

Style formatting applies changes to a style of an object. Such as setting a character style to Drop Caps. See :ref:`help_writer_format_style_char` as an example.
