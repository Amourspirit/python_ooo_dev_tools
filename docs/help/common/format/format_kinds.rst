Formatting and Styling kinds
============================

|odev| :py:mod:`ooodev.formats` provides a set of classes and functions to format and style text and documents.

There are three types of formatting and styling: ``direct``, ``modify`` and ``style``.

Direct formatting applies changes directly to an object.
Much like setting a selection of text to bold or italic in LibreOffice Writer.

Modify formatting applies changes to a style in the document. Such a character style or a paragraph style.

Style formatting applies changes to a style of an object. Such as setting a character style to Drop Caps.
